# SMART-DUSTBIN-PROJECT
Smart waste management is a growing necessity in urban areas to promote sustainability and efficiency. This project aims to develop and implement smart dustbins in Visakhapatnam, India, where the amount of waste in each dustbin is digitally monitored and managed accordingly. By integrating sensors and real-time data analytics, the system will track waste levels, optimize waste collection routes, and improve overall waste management efficiency. The project will assess the potential environmental and economic benefits of smart waste management and explore strategies for reducing waste overflow, minimizing collection costs, and promoting recycling efforts in the city.
